//! Bevy Retrograde is an opinionated plugin pack for the [Bevy] game engine with tools to help you
//! make 2D games!
//!
//! Bevy Retrograde is not specific to pixel-art games, but it does include some features that would
//! be particularly useful for pixel games. The ultimate goal is to act as an extension to Bevy that
//! gives you common tools necessary to make a 2D game such as map loading, physics, UI, save-data,
//! etc. Not all of the features we want to add are implemented yet, but we will be expanding the
//! feature set as we developer our own game with it.

//! # Development Status

//! Check out our [examples] list to see how to use each Bevy Retrograde feature:
//!
//! - Supports web and desktop out-of-the-box
//! - [LDtk](https://ldtk.io) map loading and rendering
//! - An integration with the [RAUI] UI library for building in-game user interfaces and HUD
//! - Physics and collision detection powered by [Heron] and [Rapier] with automatic generation of
//!   convex collision shapes from sprite images
//! - Text rendering of bitmap fonts in the BDF format
//! - A simple but effective sound playing API

//! # Supported Bevy Version
//!
//! Bevy Retrograde currently works on the latest Bevy release and may or may not support Bevy
//! master as well. Bevy Retrograde will try to follow the latest Bevy release, but if there are
//! features introduced in Bevy master that we need, we may require Bevy master for a time until the
//! next Bevy release.
//!
//! **`Cargo.toml`:**
//!
//! ```toml
//!  # The default-features setting is optional, but can make build times faster if you are only
//!  # developing 2D games.
//! bevy = { version = "0.6", default-features = false }
//! bevy_retrograde = "0.3.0"
//! ```
